            mini-libraries and a Central Library. We will be facilitating a central
            library and mini-libraries per community. We are committed to a library
            within every ward. for under 12. By every ward, we mean within a 15
            minutes walking distance, so every child, no matter where they were
            born, can safely have equal access to quality educational resources and
            technology. On a broader scale, in each local government/administrative
            county, a major Central Children Library and Discovery Center shall be
            built – a place where Science, Technology, Engineering, Attitude, Arts,
            and Mathematics meet and indigent/out-of-school children can have equal
            access to learning opportunities that they ordinarily cannot afford.

                Teachers need motivation, especially Teachers who do not earn much. Hence, this initiative measures the
                impact of Teachers in local schools through established best practices. The identified best Teacher,
                Prefect, and school in different categories, are acknowledged. Their contributions to the development of
                education and their community are celebrated with cash prizes. The essence is to boost their moral for
                being exceptional in the face of scarce resources, not just in academics but more importantly, for
                exploring education as a tool for development by actively finding solutions to identified problems in
                their community.

        <p><b>Local Government Accountability Forum:</b> The forum emphasizes accountability in government at the local
            level which is the unit of government closest to the grassroot where influences can be easily made. It
            provides a feedback mechanism driven by a non-state actor where leaders are made accountable. The pragmatic
            change that is expected at the national level should be driven at the local level first. We promote local
            accountability, people participation in government’s decision-making and public findings especially in
            education via this forum.</p>
        <p><b>Local Government Political Debate:</b> The Debate provides robust opportunity for the locals to interact
            with candidates vying to lead elective positions at the local government level. It educates the electorates
            at the local level to critically examine and access the quality of leadership they will have and what
            community projects should be prioritized.</p>
        <p><b>Local Government Election Awareness:</b> Awareness is created during electioneering period to get the
            locals involved in voting and voting right. Sensitization programs are organized to encourage them to obtain
            Permanent Voters Cards.</p>
        <p><b>Civic Responsibilities:</b> Periodically, the organization partners with relevant stakeholders to promote
            the culture of engaging in civic responsibilities among the residents of local communities.</p>
